## Jypter Notebooks on [Google Colab](http://colab.research.google.com)

* Select 'Runtime' -> 'Change runtime time' -> 'Python 3' (and 'GPU') before running the notebook.
* Ignore the warning: 'This notebook was not authored by Google.' Check 'Reset all runtimes before running' and click 'Run anyway'
* Use Firefox or Google Chrome if you want to upload your images.

Train or fine-tune your own model and segment your images [![Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/delkind/DeepFLaSH/blob/master/DeepFLaSH.ipynb)

You can find a comprehensive **user guide** [here](https://github.com/matjesg/DeepFLaSH/raw/master/user_guide.pdf).

## Model Library

This list contains download links to the weights of the selected models as well as an example of their corresponding training images and masks.

You can select and apply these models within our Jupyter Notebook.
* [cFOS_Wue](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1u1jAqxRpQh2hjE0W2vdHNCyhQsM5uAis): 
Trained on 36 image-mask pairs of cFOS labels in the dorsal hippocampus (including 12 images of each sub-region: dentate gyrus, CA3 and CA1). Masks for training were prepared by five independent experts. Images were acquired using laser-scanning confocal microscopy with a resolution of 1.6 pixel per µm.

* [cFOS_Inns1](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1n6oGHaIvhbcBtzrkgWT6igg8ZXSOvE0D): Fine-tuned on [cFOS_Wue](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1u1jAqxRpQh2hjE0W2vdHNCyhQsM5uAis)
with five image-mask pairs of cFOS labels in the amygdala. Masks for fine-tuning were prepared by one expert. Images acquired using epifluorescence microscopy with a resolution of 1 pixel per µm.

Fine-tuned on [cFOS_Wue](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1u1jAqxRpQh2hjE0W2vdHNCyhQsM5uAis)
with five image-mask pairs of cFOS labels in the infralimbic cortex. Masks for fine-tuning were prepared by one expert. Images acquired using epifluorescence microscopy with a resolution of 2 pixel per µm.

## Creating segmentation maps for DeepFLaSH with Fiji/ImageJ

If you don't have labelled training data available, you can use this [instruction manual](https://github.com/matjesg/DeepFLaSH/raw/master/ImageJ/create_maps_howto.pdf) for creating segmentation maps.
The ImagJ-Macro is available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matjesg/DeepFLaSH/master/ImageJ/Macro_create_maps.ijm).
